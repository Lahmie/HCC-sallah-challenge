    <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
    <p> posted by BGB, November 15, 2016.</p>
    <p> This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <em>sous vide.</em> In <em>sous vide</em> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <em>Cooking for Geeks,</em> Jeff Porter describes it as "ultra-low-temperature poaching".  </p>
    <p>Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</b></p>
    <p>Location:<br>Baker's Corner, Seekonk, MA.</p>
    <p>Hours:<br>Tuesday to Saturday, 11am to 11pm.</p>
